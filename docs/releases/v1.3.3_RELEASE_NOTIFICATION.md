## 🐛 Issues Fixed in v1.3.3

### Pattern Detection (10 Tests Fixed)
**Problem:** Pattern detection tests were asserting incorrect return types.

**Solution:** Updated pattern detection logic to properly return `Optional[str]` instead of boolean values. Affected tests now correctly validate pattern identification results.

**Tests Fixed:**
- `test_pattern_detection_setup`
- `test_moving_average_crossover_detection`
- `test_support_resistance_identification`
- And 7 additional pattern detection tests

### ML Model Integration (7 Tests Fixed)
**Problem:** LSTM and Transformer models were receiving numpy arrays but expecting PyTorch tensors.

**Solution:** Converted test inputs from numpy arrays to PyTorch tensors. All ML model tests now pass with proper tensor type handling.

**Tests Fixed:**
- `test_lstm_initialization`
- `test_lstm_forward_pass`
- `test_transformer_initialization`
- `test_transformer_forward_pass`
- And 3 additional ML model tests

### Divergence Detection (4 Tests Fixed)
**Problem:** Divergence detector required `indicator_values` parameter that was missing in tests.

**Solution:** Added required `indicator_values` parameter to divergence detection calls. All divergence tests now properly validate detection logic.

**Tests Fixed:**
- `test_divergence_detection_basic`
- `test_divergence_detection_advanced`
- And 2 additional divergence detection tests

### Version Synchronization
**Problem:** Version numbers were inconsistent across 4 files (ranging from 1.0.0 to 1.3.2).

**Solution:** Synchronized all version files to unified v1.3.3:
- `configs/VERSION`: 1.3.2 → 1.3.3
- `pyproject.toml`: 1.3.2 → 1.3.3
- `src/__init__.py`: 1.1.0 → 1.3.3
- `src/gravity_tech/__init__.py`: 1.0.0 → 1.3.3
